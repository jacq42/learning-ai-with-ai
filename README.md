# Learning AI with AI

I want to find out if I can learn AI with a learning path created by an AI chat model like [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) or [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

See [logbook](logbook/logs.md) for my progress.

## Local setup

1. Activate virtual environment for Python: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
