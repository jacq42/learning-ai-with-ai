# Learning AI with AI

I want to find out if I can learn AI with a learning path created by an AI chat model like [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) or [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

See [logbook](logbook/logs.md) for my progress.

## Learnings

- If you give the model more context of what you want to learn and what you already know, it will create a better learning path.
