# Learnings in week 1

Day 3: 
- Difference between Python dictionaries and Panda Series:
  - A Python dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a value.
  - A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a database table.
  - A Pandas Series has additional functionality for statistical operations, indexing, and data manipulation that a standard Python dictionary does not provide.
- Vectorizing:
  - Applying operations to entire arrays or data structures at once, rather then using loops.
- Alignment:
  - When performing operations between two Series (Pandas), the values are aligned based on their index labels. If the labels do not match, the result will contain NaN for those indices.
- Python learnings:
  - `__main__` is a special variable in Python that indicates whether a script is being run directly or imported as a module.
    - It is used to separate script execution from definitions (like functions/classes) 
    
Day 2:
- Python likes snake_case not camelCase.
- AI is a good pairing partner when learning structure and syntax of a not so well-known programming language like Python.
- The devil is in the details: The learning path created by Claude.ai contains hands-on exercises. I had to ask Claude to give more details about the exercises.
- The UI of Claude is nice. The artifacts are always visible on the right side. They will be updated when I ask for more details.
- I don't want to do the hole PY4E course on edX. I can switch back to it later.
- Learnings from [panda](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html):
  - pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. 

Day 1: 
- If you give the model more context want you want to learn and what you already know, it will create a better learning path.
- Learnings from PY4E course on edx:
  - Guido von Rossum = creator of Python
  - Docs: [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/book)
  - Funny video with [CPU overheat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSGcnRanYMM)
  - Python is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus
  - Charles Severance is a funny guy
  - An interesting and informative course for learning Python from scratch: do I really need it?
