Tailored for Software Developer with Java/Kotlin Background

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Quick practical application of generative AI
- Portfolio projects on GitHub/HuggingFace
- English learning app as main project
- Use and fine-tune existing models

## ðŸ“… Timeline
12 Weeks (1-2h daily)

## Phase 1: Fundamentals & Python Setup (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Preparing Python for AI

Platforms: edX + Independent Learning

- Main Course: [Python for Everybody - edX (MichiganX)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MichiganX+py4e101x+2T2024/home) - structured course with videos and exercises
- Supplementary: [PY4E - Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) (additional materials and reference)
- Focus: Python syntax, lists, dictionaries, functions, file handling
- Hands-on:
    - Set up Python environment (Anaconda/Miniconda)
    - Learn Jupyter Notebooks
    - First small Python project: Read and analyze vocabulary file
    -
```python
# Create a file "vocabulary.txt" with this format:
# apple,Apfel,fruit
# book,Buch,object  
# happy,glÃ¼cklich,emotion
# run,rennen,action

# Project tasks:
# 1. Read and parse file
# 2. Group by categories  
# 3. Output statistics (count per category)
# 4. Implement search function
# 5. Allow adding new vocabulary
```
