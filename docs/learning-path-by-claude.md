- Hands-on:
    - Set up Python environment (Anaconda/Miniconda)
    - Learn Jupyter Notebooks
    - First small Python project: [Read and analyze vocabulary file](learnings/hands-on/week1/README.md)

### Week 2: Data Science Libraries Basics

Platforms: Independent + HuggingFace Docs

Learning Goal: pandas, numpy, matplotlib fundamentals
Resources:
- [Python Data Science Handbook (free online)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- [pandas Getting Started](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html)


Hands-on:
